<pre>	
Within days of the killing of 13 unarmed civilians and the wounding of 14 others on Bloody Sunday,
 more than 500 eyewitness testimonies were recorded for presentation to the Widgery Tribunal but 
 only 15 were considered. The first edition of Eyewitness Bloody Sunday brought to light 100 witness
 statements that were officially ignored for more than two decades. This book had a phenomenal and
 far-reaching impact, profoundly weakening the official version of the events of January 30, 1972.
 In addition to giving a voice to the civilian demonstrators who witnessed the events of Bloody Sunday,
 it exposed facts supporting the hypothesis that snipers in the vicinity of the old Derry Walls might
 have shot dead three of the victims. With the Saville inquiry now into its second year of investigations,
 this book has become a pivotal source of firsthand evidence about what really happened on that tragic day. </pre>
