<pre>	
A Cook’s Book is the story of Nigel Slater’s life in the kitchen.
From the first jam tart Nigel made with his mum standing on a chair trying to reach the Aga, 
through to what he is cooking now, this is the ultimate Nigel Slater collection brimming with over 200 recipes.
He writes about how his cooking has changed from discovering the best way to roast a chicken to the trick to smoky,
smooth aubergine mash. He gives the tales behind the recipes and recalls the first time he ate a baguette in Paris,
his love of jewel-bright Japanese pickled radishes and his initial slice of buttercream-topped chocolate cake.
These are the favourite recipes Nigel Slater cooks at home every day; the heart and soul of his cooking. Chapters include:
a slice of tart, a chicken in the pot, everyday greens, the solace of soup and the ritual of tea. 
        This is the essential Nigel Slater. </pre>
